      "description": "**About Rippling**\n------------------\n\n\nRippling gives businesses one place to run HR, IT, and Finance. It brings together all of the workforce systems that are normally scattered across a company, like payroll, expenses, benefits, and computers. For the first time ever, you can manage and automate every part of the employee lifecycle in a single system.\n\n\nTake onboarding, for example. With Rippling, you can hire a new employee anywhere in the world and set up their payroll, corporate card, computer, benefits, and even third\\-party apps like Slack and Microsoft 365\u2014all within 90 seconds.\n\n\nBased in San Francisco, CA, Rippling has raised $1\\.4B\\+ from the world\u2019s top investors\u2014including Kleiner Perkins, Founders Fund, Sequoia, Greenoaks, and Bedrock\u2014and was named one of America's best startup employers by Forbes.\n\n  \n\nWe prioritize candidate safety. Please be aware that all official communication will only be sent from @Rippling.com addresses.\n\n**About the role**\n------------------\n\n\nEvery year, employers and employees spend over $5 trillion on benefits globally. From health insurance to saving for retirement, these benefits products guide families through some of the most important and impactful decisions in life.\n\n\nDespite the significance of these products and the dollars spent, the experience is still painfully antiquated, expensive, and confusing.\n\n  \n\nRippling is building the first modern marketplace that seamlessly connects brokers, employers, and employees with any benefit. Our platform powers discovery, purchase, and use of benefits products around the world. Our benefits vertical includes our Benefits Platform (recommendations, payments, and our benefits eligibility engine), our rapidly growing Benefits Marketplace of over 100 partners, and our natively\\-built Rippling Benefits Products.  \n\n  \n\nWe\u2019re looking for a **Director of Product** who will lead the entire Benefits Marketplace in the US and dozens of other countries \u2013 as well as the Professional Employer Organization (PEO) offering. This includes new platform capabilities to win upmarket, brand new benefits product offerings, reimagining how employees navigate the complex world of benefits (including through AI\\-powered capabilities), making the marketplace a truly compelling experience with the right options for customers of all sizes, and rolling out in new geographies. All of this needs to be done while ensuring the vertical can scale with Rippling\u2019s growth, leverage its unique knowledge of Employee and Organizational Data, and fulfill enrollments with absolute accuracy.\n\n **What you will do**\n\n* Own the vision and execution of Rippling\u2019s benefits marketplace and PEO\n* Build and manage a high\\-performing team: lead a team of senior Product Leads with the ability to attract and develop world\\-class talent\n* Serve as a leader and mentor for the broader Product Management function in Bangalore\n* Transform complexity into simplicity by crafting an intuitive, simple experience that works for companies with 1 through 10,000 employees\n* Scale our current platform to support tens of millions of employees\n* Work cross\\-functionally with virtually every team \u2013 across product, engineering, design, marketing, and customer\\-facing functions \u2013 to develop the first modern marketplace for benefits products that can scale to billions in revenue.\n* Stay deeply attuned to market trends, customer feedback, and emerging technologies to ensure the Benefits vertical can win with administrators, brokers, and employees against both point solutions and all\\-in\\-one competitors\n\n**What you will need**\n----------------------\n\n* 12\\+ years of Product Management experience\n* Led both 01 product builds and large\\-scale products with millions of active users.\n* Self\\-starter with a bias towards action\n* Ability to thrive in a fast\\-paced environment\n* Thrives in understanding complexity and transforming it into simple user experiences\n* Helicopter pilot mentality \\- you can easily switch from high level strategy and planning to UI polish and data model details\n* Leads with clarity and inspiration, enabling teams to perform at their peak.\n* Possess a deep sense of ownership and responsibility and understand that the buck stops with you\n* Strong alignment with our leadership principles: in particular Go and See, and Are Right, a Lot.\n* Experience building regulated products in the healthcare, employer benefits, and/or fintech industry will be a plus",
